 * Google Analytics 4.

 * public by design — it ships in the page source of every site that uses GA —
 * so hiding it would buy nothing, while a missing CI variable would switch
 * analytics off silently.
 *
 * Replacing the ID with the placeholder turns every export here into a no-op —
 * no script is loaded and nothing is sent — so the file can be carried into a
 * new project without it reporting into this property.
